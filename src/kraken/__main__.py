"""Kraken's public market data as an Open Meridian data plugin.

It connects to the sidecar it is launched beside, declaring its catalogue,
its storage and its settings (declaration.py) and its pages (page.py), and
serves them. Then it maps Kraken's products to the deployment's instruments
(products.py), hears what the lake wants of it and records it, and keeps each
standing want current (dgm.py) -- from contract v19 its trades and best bid
and offer from the venue's stream, kept open while a standing want puts
anything on it (stream.py) -- until stopped. Everything goes through the
sidecar; nothing but Kraken's public REST and its stream are called, and with sample data
not even that (synthetic.py).

It holds nothing it cannot lose: Kraken's raw responses and the product map
are kept in the storage the deployment grants it (decisions/028), and a
restart reads the map back and hears again what the lake wants.
