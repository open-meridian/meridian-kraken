"""Kraken's public market data: the one module that speaks to it.

REST at api.kraken.com/0/public/: `AssetPairs`, `Assets`, `OHLC` (daily, the
720 most recent entries at most), `Ticker`, `Depth` (the level-1 book) and
`Trades`; and from contract v19 the stream at ws.kraken.com/v2 (`STREAM`; the
socket is stream.py's, what is said on it convert.py's). No key: nothing
here holds a credential, and nothing is sent but the request.
The standard library's HTTP client; the plugin depends on nothing but the
SDK.

**Rate limits, honoured.** Kraken limits public REST by IP, and `OHLC` and
`Trades` by pair besides; about one call a second stays inside, so this
client spends at most that from a token bucket. A rate limit -- HTTP 429, or
Kraken's `EGeneral:Too many requests` under HTTP 200 -- is waited out, 2, 4,
8 seconds, and asked again at most three times, each one counted.

**Errors under HTTP 200.** Kraken answers most refusals with status 200 and a
non-empty `error` list: an answer is good only with an empty one.

**Every response is a raw record first** (raw.py), kept exactly as its bytes
arrived, with its status and freshness headers, before anything is read from
it. A body is parsed with `json_decimal`: Kraken sends its figures as
strings, read as Decimals, and a JSON number, where one appears, from its
own text.

**Where it answers from.** Kraken itself; or, in synthetic mode, the synthetic
exchanges this package carries, or a developer's recorded ones, through the
same requests (synthetic.py).
