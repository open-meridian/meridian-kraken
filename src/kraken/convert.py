"""Kraken's answers, read into the venue's values (market.py): the one place
Kraken's vocabulary is read.

Kraken names everything its own way: assets by legacy codes (`XXBT` for
bitcoin, whose altname is `XBT`, never `BTC`; `ZUSD` for the dollar), pairs by
keys built from them (`XXBTZUSD`) and by altnames (`XBTUSD`). A pair names a
market, not an asset: its base is a row's subject, priced in its quote.

**Assets** (the plan's "Identifiers for a pair"; the product owner's ruling of
2026-10-03 on a venue's balance in a multi-network token):

- **A currency** is a cash instrument, by its ISO 4217 code, for the fiat
  asset codes Kraken documents (FIAT, below). Kraken's `Assets` does not say
  which assets are fiat (every one is `aclass: currency`), and a `Z` is no
  sign of one (`ZAMA` and `ZBCN` are tokens), so the table is the plugin's,
  keyed by Kraken's codes; a code not in it resolves by its code until a
  person adds it.
- **A native coin** carries its CAIP-19 by SLIP-44 coin type (`XXBT`, `XETH`).
- **Every other token** is Kraken's own instrument: Kraken's public API states
  no network and no contract for any asset, so none carries a contract's
  CAIP-19; each is known by its code with source `kraken` alone. Never
  guessed from a ticker.
- **A stablecoin is a token,** never its currency (decisions/030): a pair
  quoted in `USDC` is quoted in Kraken's USDC instrument, and Kraken's own
  `USDCUSD` is the dataset's price for valuing it (the plan's Q25).

**OHLC** entries are `[time, open, high, low, close, vwap, volume, count]`,
every figure a string, `time` the day's start at 00:00 UTC; the last entry is
the day still forming. A day with no trades (`count` 0) has no
volume-weighted price, whatever Kraken writes in its place.

**The ticker's** `c` is the last trade's price; Kraken states no time and no
trade identity for it, so it is in force from when its answer arrived and is
known by that answer's place in the raw record. **The level-1 book's** best
bid and ask are `Depth`'s first `bids` and `asks`, `[price, volume, time]`, in
force from the later side's time, each volume its side's size.

**Trades** (contract v19): `Trades` states each as `[price, volume, time,
side, order type, misc, trade_id]`, its time a JSON number of seconds read
from its own text, and the stream's `trade` channel as `price`, `qty`,
`side`, `ord_type`, `trade_id` and `timestamp`. The side is **the taker's**,
the one that took liquidity (Kraken's documentation), recorded as the
aggressor as sent; the taker's order type stays in the raw record. Kraken
states no condition codes. **The stream** is Kraken's v2: pairs by their
`wsname`, with bitcoin's `XBT` as `BTC` and `XDG` as `DOGE` (its v2
documentation), its figures JSON numbers read from their own text; the
`ticker` channel, asked for each change of the best bid and offer
(`event_trigger` `bbo`), states them with their sizes (`bid`, `bid_qty`,
`ask`, `ask_qty`) at its `timestamp`. A `trade` snapshot, the pair's last 50,
comes on subscribing. Every message is kept as a raw record before it is
read, but a heartbeat, which states nothing.
