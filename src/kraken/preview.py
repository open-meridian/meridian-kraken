"""The pages as a deployment admin would see them, on synthetic data, each
printed as one HTML file: for looking at them without a deployment.

    python -m kraken.preview connection > preview/connection.html
    python -m kraken.preview datasets > preview/datasets.html
    python -m kraken.preview datasets-empty > preview/datasets-empty.html

The page links the kit where the dashboard serves it, /.meridian/ui/<version>/,
so serve it beside the kit to see it styled (meridian-ui's `make serve`);
opened on its own it is the page without the kit, unstyled, which works too.

There is no sidecar here: the SDK's `Recorder` answers as one would, the
deployment holding two custodian's records (bitcoin and ether, by their
CAIP-19s and the custodian's symbols), the venue answers from the synthetic
exchanges this package carries, and the lake asks for a run of days and
keeps two subjects current, as a reader would make it, so the Datasets page
has wants to page through and search (the kit's search, in the browser);
their products are streamed from the synthetic venue's first connection,
which drops, so Connection says how the stream has gone. A deployment
admin has licensed the daily dataset and not the others (contract v20).
`datasets-empty` is the page of a plugin just started, before the lake has
asked anything: its next step, as a deployment admin sees it.
