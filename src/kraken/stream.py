"""A venue's stream: one WebSocket, spoken with the standard library, and kept
open -- reconnected after a drop, the gap filled from the venue's history.

The same module in meridian-coinbase and meridian-kraken. What is said on the
stream -- the subscription, and what each message means -- is each plugin's
`convert.py`; the socket, the reconnecting and the pacing are here, once.

**The socket** (RFC 6455, client side): a TLS connection, the HTTP upgrade
with its key checked against the answer's accept, text frames masked as a
client must, a ping answered with its pong, fragments joined, and a close
answered. No extension is asked for, so no message arrives compressed. The
plugin depends on nothing but the SDK, so there is no WebSocket library.

**Kept open** (the plan's row 19): a stream that drops, or says nothing for
`SILENT_SECONDS`, is opened again after a wait that doubles from one second
to a minute, reset once a connection has stayed up a minute: inside Kraken's
150 reconnects in ten minutes per IP, and Coinbase's. Each time it opens,
`opened` is called before any message is read, so the plugin can fill the gap
from the venue's REST history (dgm.py: the trades after the last one it
recorded), and readers catch up from the lake by the watermark they last
saw.

**Synthetic mode**: `Replayed` answers the subscription with messages shaped
exactly as the venue sends them, then falls silent, held open, or drops as a
venue's connection does; the synthetic venue's first connection drops, so
the reopening and the gap read back are proved in CI.
