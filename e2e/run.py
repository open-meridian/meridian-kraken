"""`make e2e` and `make e2e-recorded`: the plugin end to end on core's plugin
harness (contracts v18 and v19), in synthetic mode, beside a reader
(e2e/reader.py).

1. Launched: the plugin registers its catalogue; the deployment admin's tool
   lists its three datasets, `daily`, `live` and `trades`, each on the UTC day
   ending at 00:00, with their modes.
2. Synthetic mode on: the plugin reads its listing and mints no record for
   any asset (the first build minted one per asset); the venue, which the
   harness's deployment does not hold (it has no platform), reported
   missing. The reader then names bitcoin as a custodian's book holds it,
   by its CAIP-19 and the custodian's symbol, and the dollar and the euro by
   ISO 4217.
3. Licensed and entitled: the admin licenses the three datasets and entitles
   the reader to them, the broker reloaded with each.
4. A close wanted: the reader reads the custodian's bitcoin's closes for a
   day nothing has recorded; the lake asks the plugin, which reads the
   record (W3.6, a dgm's from contract v18 as ruled 2026-10-10), names it
   Kraken's XXBT by its CAIP-19, joins its own code to it, and records
   XXBTZUSD's close in dollars and XBTUSDC's on USDC's own instrument --
   resolved then, the one record it mints -- exactly as the venue stated
   them, on that business date, each naming its raw record and the venue as
   reported; the reader reads both, and hears them -- following BTC's
   prices, trades and quotes, whose latest quote stands as a want of the
   live dataset. No record was minted for an asset no subject is.
5. Declined, and a rate: a read of the dollar's closes, which no pair's base
   is, is declined as not covered; the euro's, recorded from EUR/USD in
   dollars: an FX rate on a currency's cash instrument.
6. Live: a read of BTC's latest on the live dataset stands as a want, which
   the plugin keeps current -- the last trade's price and the best bid and
   offer of each product -- until the lake withdraws it.
7. Streamed (contract v19): the standing want puts BTC's pairs on Kraken's
   v2 stream; the synthetic venue drops the first connection, the plugin
   opens it again and reads the trades it missed from Kraken's `Trades`, so
   every trade is recorded once in `trades`, its aggressor the side that took
   liquidity (Kraken's taker side as sent), eligible for every statistic,
   exactly as stated, with no business date; the reader reads them over the
   day, and after the watermark it saw, and hears them; and reads each
   pair's latest quote in `live`, with its sizes.
8. Parity: the plugin's two read tools answer through the deployment's MCP
   what its two pages show, the stream's session among them.
9. Its raw responses are in its granted storage, and `store lake` prints
   each row kept, numbered with no holes in each dataset, the wants asked,
   answered, declined and withdrawn, and the venue's miss.

Run from the repository's root by the Makefile, which builds the image,
copies the harness out and writes the plugins' compose file first, and
exports what the compose files read. Standard library only.
