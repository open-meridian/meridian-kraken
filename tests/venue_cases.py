"""Kraken's side of the data suite: this plugin's synthetic exchanges, named for
what each of the suite's cases asks a source to present.

tests/test_suite.py, the same file in meridian-coinbase, runs the SDK's data
suite unchanged against each plugin's own conversion; this module is the one
place it learns which venue it is holding. Each answer comes through the
plugin's real client, raw records and reading (synthetic.py's transport over
the exchanges this package carries, `src/kraken/synthetic/`), with invented
values; real recordings are never committed (Kraken asks its permission for
non-personal use; the plan's Q11).
